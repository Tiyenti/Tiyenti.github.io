# Distance Glossary [2.0 beta I guess]
This is intended to be something of an updated version of my old Distance glossary, with more
detailed descriptions and cleaning things up to remove several outdated terms, other definitons that I rarely actually saw used regularly, and terms that the game itself uses
(and therefore seem unncessary to mention). This list is not guarunteed to be completed
at the moment, but I wanted to release something since the old glossary was outdated
as hell and there was nothing else readily available.

Ping @Tiyenti#3201 on Discord if you have any suggestions.

## Air Control Map
A level that is typically designed to require large amounts of [gripflight](#gripfly) and/or wing control in order to complete. See also [hard map](#hard-map) - a related concept that overlaps with this one, although not all air control maps may necessarily be described as hard maps.

## Air Roll
A control option that refers to rolling while airborne, with either the thrusters *or* the wings.

The term "air roll" is also used loosely to refer to the entire collection of airborne rotation controls, and thus will often include not just air roll, but also air pitch. The air roll control options are used in [single stick](#single-stick) control schemes, allowing the same stick to be used for steering on the ground, but switching to rotation while in the air. Contrast [jet roll](#jet-roll), which is used any time, including on the ground, as long as wings are not open, and [wing roll](#wing-roll), which is only used when wings *are* open.

## Barrel Troll
A phenonemon where the game seemingly fails to register barrel roll tricks, despite a full roll being completed visually speaking. Barrel trolls usually happen due to quirks with how the trick system sets the origin point of the roll. It's possible to learn how work around this to avoid getting barrel trolled, but it can be extremely annoying when one happens unexpectedly. <!-- Added 2021-12-11. -->

## Birotational Transfer
A [transfer](#transfer) that requires rotating on both the pitch and roll axes to complete. Also referred to as a *double-axis transfer*.

## Blue Thrusters
The state of the thrusters before [thruster rampdown](#thruster-rampdown) kicks in, named from the fact that, while in this state, the thrusters will be colored blue while using grip. The blue thrusters state is noticeably more powerful than the orange thrusters one and, with good angles, can allow for net velocity even greater than that of your normal *ground* boosting speed, not just air boosting.

## Boat Map
A particular style of map. Boat maps traditionally refered to maps that required the player to fly while the car was upside down on the ground, usually using a quirk with [killgrid](#killgrid) behaviour that prevented the car from driving normally, but a more modern variation of the concept involves using [force zones](#force-zones) to create the effect of water that the car floats on, requiring the use of [gripflight](#gripfly).

## Bubble
The purple sphere used as part of the Reverse Tag mode that denotes the player who is currently it.
<!-- C -->
## Credit Card Skip
A term referring to any [skip](#skip) that requires getting sliced by a laser to reduce the car's hitbox size, in order squeeze through a gap that would otherwise be impossible to enter. A particularly infamous credit card skip exists in the Lost to Echoes category, on the level "It Was Supposed To Be Perfect".
<!-- D -->
## Drag Trigger
A trigger that affects the car's drag value, and therefore its top speed. Drag triggers are often used to reduce the drag value in order to provide speed boosts, and some of these are used in specific maps as part of an author intended [skip](#skip).

## Dual Stick
Refers to a control scheme, typically on a gamepad, where steering and thruster/rotation control are placed on different control sticks; typically, steering on the left stick, and thrusters on the right. The default keyboard control scheme is technically an example of a dual stick control scheme, outside of, you know, not having any control sticks.

Broadly, dual stick may also include simply mapping wing roll to a different stick instead of all rotational controls, although the term "dual stick" generally invokes a specific idea that this would not count for. Contrast [single stick](#single-stick).
<!-- E -->
<!-- F -->
<!--## Fast Reset
Pressing the [reset](#reset) button during the death animation to respawn instantly.-->

## Force Zone
An object that applies a particular force to the car while it is inside of it. This can be either a wind force or even outright changing the direction of gravity. Force zones are often used for speed boosts or other wacky custom physics shenanigans.

## Full Game Run
A general speedrunning term. In the wider speedrunning community, "full game" is generally used to refer to speedrunning the entire game, in constrast to [individual level](#individual-level-il) runs. In Distance specifically it usually refers to speedrunning at least one campaign or arcade level set in a single sitting.
<!-- G -->
## Gripflight
A physics technique that allows you to fly without opening the car's wings by using grip while upside down. Gripfly has uses not only in [infected zones](#infected-zone) and levels that disable wings, but also in general play as it allows you to avoid the slowdown that opening wings results in. 
<!-- H -->
## Hard Map
The term "hard map" or "hard level" is often used to refer to a specific concept within the Distance community, typically referring to a level designed to require precise [gripflight](#gripfly) or other air control, that is extremely difficult to complete. The concept of a hard map has significant overlap with [air control maps](#air-control-map), due to air control generally being a requirement, but the terms aren't entirely synonymous as air control maps don't necessarily *have* to be difficult to complete.
<!-- I -->
## Individual Level (IL)
A general speedrunning term that refers to speedrunning only a single level. Contrast a [full game run](#full-game-run).

## Infected Zone
An area of a level that disables the car's wings while it is inside of it. Infected zones are common in the later levels of the Adveture and Legacy level sets. Infected zones are also sometimes called *wing corruption zones* in reference to their internal object name, `WingCorruptionZone`.

## Infinite Cooldown
A setting that some maps may enable that makes it impossible to overheat by most means. It's still possible to overheat by having all four of the car's wheels sliced off, but this is a fairly specific scenario that doesn't come up too often to begin with, so under most circumstances, it's you pretty much can't die to overheating with this setting enabled. Also sometimes referred to as *infinite boost*, as it, well, lets you boost for a theoretically infinite amount of time.
<!-- J -->
## Jet Roll
A control option that refers to rolling with the rotation thrusters (also known as jets), applying all the time, including on the ground, as long as wings are not currently open.

The term "jet roll" is also used loosely to refer to the entire collection of thruster related rotation controls, and thus often not only includes jet roll, but also jet pitch. The jet roll control options are used in [dual stick](#dual-stick) control schemes. Contrast [air roll](#air-roll), which applies whenever you're in the air, regardless of if you have wings open or not, and [wing roll](#wing-roll), which applies *only* when wings are open.
<!-- K -->
## Killgrid
An object that looks like a hexagonal laser grid that will kill any player that touches it. Killgrids are generally used to create boundaries in maps, especially lower boundaries, so that a player who doesn't know how to [reset](#reset) won't just fall forever if they accidentally fall off the map.
<!-- L -->
<!-- M -->
## Magnet Boosting
A technique that involves using the [wheel magnets](#wheel-magnets) in order to gain a positional or speed advantage; an example of this would be gliding very close to a ceiling to gain height as you pass under it. A particular advantage to this is that you don't need to tilt up, allowing you to gain height without reducing your forward momentum.

It's also possible to further utilize the force that the magnets provide by tilting slightly down while under the effects of them, making them pull the car slightly forward as well as up, although this is hard to do.

## Refractor
The internal name of the Spectrum, the default car. Used to be exclusively used to refer to this car during the beta as the canon name was unknown at the time. In modern times, it still gets used occasionally, mostly by veteran players from the beta days, although just calling it the Spectrum is generally more common these days.

## Reset
An action that allows you to die on command, allowing you to quickly head back to the last checkpoint you hit. Often used you've gotten lost, or if you know you're gonna die anyway and want to accelerate the proccess.

In the speedrunning community, the term "reset" is also commonly used in the traditional speedrunning sense of stopping a currently in-progress attempt and starting a new one. The fact the same term is used for both actions can be somewhat confusing, but context should help you figure out which definition is meant.

<!-- S -->
## Sawboosting
Intentionally hitting a saw with the intention of using its rotation to boost the car's speed. The reward for successfully sawboosting can be massive depending on the map, although whether it works or not is pretty much entirely down to luck. See also [roller boosting](#roller-boosting) and [mine boosting](#mine-boosting) for other "damage boosting" techniques.

## Shiver Space
A name given to the regions of game space that are extremely far away from the level's center point (coordinates 0,0,0). At these extreme distances, the game begins to suffer from floating point precision errors, causing a variety of unusual effects that include the car appearing to shake (or shiver, hence the name). <!-- Added 2021-12-11. -->

## Single Stick
Refers to a control scheme, typically on a gamepad, that uses only one control stick for both rotation and thruster inputs. The default gamepad control scheme is an example of a single stick layout. Many single stick control scheme players will, however, map [wing roll](#wing-roll) to a seperate control stick, as the default single stick scheme does not allow you to roll and steer with wings at the same time. Contrast [dual stick](#dual-stick).

<!--## Short Hop
Using grip after a jump to reduce jump height.-->

## Skip
An alternate route or strategy that differs from the main intended route for a level that allows you to complete it faster. While the term "skip" often implies that the route in question was unintended, there is little such distinction within the Distance community, and even entirely intended shortcuts are often referred to simply as "skips" for the sake of convenience.
<!-- T -->
## Thrusterboosting (TB)
A physics technique where rapidly circling rotation thruster inputs while upside down allows you to fly without using wings. Very similar to [gripflight](#gripflight) in function, although much more difficult to perform, especially on keyboard control schemes.

Thrusterboosting is technically faster than gripflight, although the difficulty of optimally performing the technique makes it unviable in most scenarios.

## Thruster Rampdown
A mechanic where the thrusters will become weaker after about 2 seconds of use while in the air. This is indicated while using grip; [thrusters will be colored blue](#blue-thrusters) while at maximum power, before turning orange once rampdown takes effect. Thruster rampdown is reset whenever even just a single wheel contacts a surface, allowing for moves known as [thruster resets](#thruster-reset).

## Thruster Reset
Generally refers to, speficically, landing on a surface for a brief time with only a single wheel in order to reset [thruster rampdown](#thruster-rampdown) and regain [blue thrusters](#blue-thrusters).

## Tight Turning
Steering while inputting a rotation thruster in the same direction to turn tighter than normal. On the default controller scheme, tight turns can be peformed by holding grip and tilting the left stick, although on [dual stick](#dual-stick) schemes, both sticks must be held in the same direction to perform one.

## Transfer
A jump between two solid surfaces that requires a rotation. Transfers come in many forms, including basic floor-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling, ceiling-to-wall, etc., but also in more complicated forms, such as the [birotational or double-axis transfer](#birotational-transfer) that requires rotation on both the pitch and roll axes to complete.

<!-- ## Transfer Buffering
Holding a thruster input slightly before jumping for a transfer, allowing the rotation to be completed slightly faster.-->

<!-- U -->
## Unity
The game engine Distance runs on, for one, but a specific defintion of "Unity" within the community is as a term to refer to getting stuck in the ground, temporaily phasing into objects before being bounced out, as well as other strange physiscs behaviour, that is often referred to as "getting Unity'd".

Unitying is sort of recognised in the game itself as a sort of easter egg; likely a debugging feature that was left in for the full release, if the game detects a Unity, the death message will display with a question mark at the end (e.g. *Tiyenti got wrecked?*)

<!-- V -->
<!-- W -->
## Wheelieboosting (WB)
A physics technique involving jumping, tilting upwards, and using grip to push the car forward while still in the air. Wheelieboosts can be chained rapidly while on the ground to gain immense amounts of speed. It's similar to bunnyhopping in FPS games, although we call it wheelieboosting instead because we're weird.

Wheelieboosting is often frowned upon by the community and many players refuse to use it out of pride, so despite allowing for faster times, the mechanic does not see much actual use. Some community-created leaderboards have either implemented filters (like the [speedrun community](https://speedrun.com/distance/)) or have outright invalidated runs that use wheelieboosting (such as the [Power Rankings](https://seekr.pw/distance-pr/)).

It should be noted that there are some instances of wheelieboost-like motions that are *not* generally considered to be abusing the technique. The exact definition of what is and isn't a WB may be contentious depending on the person, but the general rule of thumb is that if you *have* to jump anyway, it's not a WB.

## Wheel Magnets
A name given to the force that pulls the car towards nearby solid surfaces, allowing it to perform wall and ceiling rides. The force of the magnets increase with speed, meaning that the car is able to un-stick from walls and ceilings if it stops moving.

The force the magnets provide can be utilized for positional or speed advantages by using [magnet boosting](#magent-boosting).

## Wing Pumping
Opening and closing wings in short bursts. Often used to change direction while [gripflying](#gripfly), as wings are both much more manueverable and are easier to conserve momentum with. Wing pumping can also be used to maintain height while rolling, as well as being used as a sort of double jump to quickly gain height.

## Wing Roll
A control option that refers to rolling while wings are open.

The term "wing roll" is often used loosely to refer to the entire collection of wing-related rotation controls, and thus, under this defintion, includes not only wing roll, but also wing pitch as well - although wing yaw is often not included in this definition as the main purpose is to contrast similar loose definitions for [jet roll](#jet-roll) and [air roll](#air-roll), which do not have yaw axis rotation.
