# Tiyenti's Texts - Writeups
Occasional longer-form writing I've done. These are usually in the form of blog posts or essays; maybe in the future I will consider archiving
some of my social media threads here. Let me know if there is a particular thread or post you would like to see me archive here; I don't really
remember them all off the top of my head.

Ultimately the format of these is not set in stone and may be somewhat experimental as I don't do blog posts or essay style writing very often.
I want to do it more, but any time I consider it I tend to grapple with both uncertainty as to what to write about as well as feeling a bit
constrained by the format of posts that I have already written, so I don't really want to advertise myself as having A Blog; so instead, here's
a manually updated list. We'll see if I go back to an actual blog feed at some point or figure out some way to automate this eventually.
