# Tiyenti's Texts - Writeups
Occasional longer-form writing I've done, whether that be in the form of blog posts, essays,
or simple articles. I'm not super wanting to advertise that I have a
blog or anything right now; I haven't done traditional blogging in *years* and I've always
struggled with finding interesting things to write about, so for the time being I'm going to
keep a manually updated index of links to a variety of things that I've written that I think
are interesting enough to share, which may or may not be hosted on this site or simply linked to
the external source where I originally wrote it.

There are probably things I've written that aren't on here, although since I've never really kept
all my writing in a consistent place, it's hard to remember it all. If there's something I've
written in the past that you think is worth linking to here, I guess you can let me know and I'll
consider adding it to the list. Future blog posts or writeups will probably be more consistently
updated and listed on here though.
