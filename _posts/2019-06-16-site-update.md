Hey. As you can see, I've updated this here GitHub Pages site to be a bit less... placeholder-y.
There's, like, an actual *design* now, and it's a lot easier to make new pages for it now since
I decided to stop using manual HTML for everything and just use Jekyll. This means I also have this
blog now, I guess. Not exactly sure what I'm going to *use* it for, mind you, but in case I ever want
to write something I guess I have it now.

I'm not 100% satisfied with the design of this place just yet so there may be some slight changes here and there
as I mess with it a little. Plus, I have some old pages here - for instance, my old writeup on Distance's cooldown
curve - which are not being processed by Jekyll, and I may update them to fit in with the rest of the site; I've also
not learned everything this software has to offer, so I'll probably add some stuff that I think is a good idea once I figure
out how. Even in this early state, though, this place is already looking much better than it was before this.

I've got nothing else to say here, so for the time being, I'm out. Can't guaruntee I'll post on here again, but we'll see.
