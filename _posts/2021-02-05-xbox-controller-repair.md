title: The Process of Reparing my Xbox One Elite Controller

I did say I wanted to do some more long-form writing from time to time... and since I was posting about this sort of half between the Distance Discord and recently on Twitter, I guess this is a good place to start off doing that by writing about exactly what the title says - the process of reparing the controller that I use for speedrunning Distance, which is probably what you know me for if you have any cognition of my existence, let's be honest :P

Without further ado, let's get into it!

## The Backstory
For those who aren't aware, I've been using a first gen Xbox One Elite controller to do my Distance speedruns for several years now. If you want my opinion on this controller, here's a quick review just for the hell of it: It's got a nice build, and the extra grip buttons on the back? Should be a standard feature of every controller, honestly. But there is some issues with it. Of course, the main thing is that it's about £120 from what I can remember - and there is a very bad build quality issue with it, that honestly should be a dealbreaker for this controller completely, and to any reasonable person it should be - it's just those extra back buttons that keep me using these things.

That design fault has been well documented across the internet at this point, so it's possible you already know what it is - it's the bumpers. The bumpers on the Gen 2 Xbox One controllers - which the Gen 1 Elite is based off of - are *notoriously* fragile due to their design, and it's likely that they'll break if you're doing anything serious with them for too long.

Apparently, this design *has* thankfully been altered on the newer Xbox controllers, which includes the more recent Elite Series 2 (though I have not really used these newer iterations much, so I can't vouch for their long term durability) -  but this was obvioulsy not the controller I was using. I was using the first gen Elite, which does indeed have these flawed bumpers.

And this bumper failure is what eventually lead to me making this post right here, since [as you will have seen if you follow me on Twitter already](https://twitter.com/TiyentiSR/status/1353862760367611905), recently my controller's right bumper started to give out. It wasn't completeley broken, but the feedback was all wack and it was dropping my hold inputs more often than I reset runs on LtE, so it had become effectively useless for speedrunning. As such, I had a situation on my hands, given that Distance speedrunning is - and has always largely been - my primary hobby.

This isn't the first time this has happened to me - although the last time it was my left bumper that broke. Back then, I just ended up getting another controller. This time, though, I decided to do what I probably should've done the first time (especially since that one broke after just 9 months) - I just bought a replacement bumper kit, and decided to take matters into my own hands.

## The Decision

The reason why this is a smart idea is... well, like, it's a controller that costs over £100. With how infamously fragile these things are, do you really want to be spending that kind of money every time they break? Nah. I don't think so. Compare that to the ~£20 it took me to get a bumper replacement kit that contained 2 replacement bumper assemblies, and the screwdriver and prying tools I would need to fix it myself? I think we all know which one is the most economic here.

In defense of the controller, this second controller did at least last longer than 9 months, which is what my first Elite lasted for - this one lasted about 3 years before finally developing the bumper fault, and I probably could be excused if I really did just want to get a third controller, potentially even upgrading to the likely more durable Series 2. But given that there was still nothing else wrong with the controller besides the broken right bumper, I figure it'd be better to just repair it anyway - and since this kit gave me two replacement sets, I could also repair my other broken Elite controller as well, so I could bring that one back to life too if I ever needed a second controller.

Apparently, the fix was pretty simple, so this is the path I decided to take. Obviously, since I'm writing about it now.

...

It, uh. It ended up being more difficult that I was lead to believe. But that was mostly just doing the first and last steps of the repair job, to be honest. We'll get to that :P

## The Repair

Ordering the replacement bumpers took a few days to arrive, but once I did end up getting them, I got to work quickly to attempt to repair them. Following some trusty YouTube video tutorials (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR6TuCnV0k8) or [this other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdx-y29mHTo)), I went armed with the knowledge of somewhat understanding what I was supposed to be doing!

The first step was to unscrew the five screws on the back of the controller. One of these was fairly easily accessible, just being underneath the sticker under the battery compartment, but the next four that I needed to unscrew were much more difficult to get off, as in order to get to them you need to pry off the back rubber grips. This was a trial. It took me quite a while but eventually I did manage to get off the grips to access the screws below them:

From there, I began to work at unscrewing those screws, to release the face plate of the controller so I could lift up the old bumper assembly and then slot in my replacement.

Also, I lost a screw in the process of doing this. Yeah. I dropped it after unscrewing it and I have zero idea where it went. I did search for it for a while, but I think it's gone forever. Oh well. A minor casuality. Shouldn't be a huge deal.

Anyway, once I removed and carefully stored the other four screws I didn't immediately drop after releasing them from their holes, I could remove the faceplate of the controller and begin the process of bumper repair.

{% include img.html src="https://i.imgur.com/Nn8iPSb.jpg" alt="Slightly out of focus photo of the aformentioned controller with its faceplate removed. Among the assorted items also visible are the back grips, a screwdriver, two blue pry tools, and one of the bumper assemblies that will be used to repair the controller." caption="Yes this is slightly out of focus. The replacement bumper is up in the top left corner, if you're curious what that is." %}

From here, things got kinda tricky. From the guides I had watched, I knew that I should lift the old bumper assembly out of the controller from the bottom, but I wasn't really able to get it up initally. I ended up having to use one of the plastic pry tools that came with the replacement kit to release it off of the controller body, but nevertheless, I was able to get it off. For fun, we can also take a look and see what happened to the right bumper - a tiny little snap:

{% include img.html src="https://i.imgur.com/QuVtNzb.jpg" alt="View of the underside of the broken bumper assembly. There is a small crack visible in the plastic that allows the right bumper to click down." %}

But getting back to the point; after this, I could then begin the process of actually fitting the replacement parts. From what I had seen from the guides I had consulted, it seemed simple. Just take the replacement bumper assembly, slot in the back pegs into the slots in the back of the controller, and then push everything down until it clicks. Seems simple enough, right...?

Uh.

Wrong, apparently? I don't entirely know what I was doing wrong here, but I really struggled with this part, and it ended up taking me several hours before I was able to properly seat in the bumper assembly and close up the controller...

For a while, when I was first attempting to slot in the replacement assembly, I just couldn't get the bumpers to seat at all, no matter what I tried. I had to look in the comments of one of the guides I had consulted in order to find out that there were actually tabs on the bumpers themselves that also needed to be inserted into some slots on the front, and part of the reason why it wasn't going in was because those tabs were in front of those slots rather than behind them. This helped somewhat, but it still took me a long time before I was finally able to seat them properly at all...

What didn't help in this regard is that the green wireless sync button was also a massive pain in the arse as it *kept falling out* and I had to keep putting it back into its slot! It was even slightly terrifying at first when it first happened, because I didn't know where it actually was meant to slot into, but thankfully I did figure that out. I don't have any image of this I don't think, but if you ever have to attempt this repair yourself, it's slotted into a little tiny enclave on the top left corner of the big Xbox button.

Also irritating is that sometimes when I was pulling the back of the controller away from the front to give myself more breathing room, sometimes the triggers would pop out and lock up completely, so that was another thing I had to deal with...

In any case, continuing to the bumper replacement once more, eventually I did manage to get the bumpers to properly seat into their slots, and hey! They worked! But there was still a big problem, and that was that the center piece wasn't locking in. I couldn't get the thing over the Xbox button in the center in order for it to successfuly click down. I have no idea what I was doing wrong, but for whatever reason I just could not get the thing in.

{% include img.html src="https://i.imgur.com/pbiH78u.jpg" alt="The faceplate-less Xbox Elite controller face up on the desk once again. This time, the replacement bumper assembly is on the controller, but the center portion between the two bumpers is slightly raised, rather than sitting flush with the central Xbox logo button." caption="This was the closest I could get for hours... note how the center frame is slightly raised off of the center button here." %}

Now, one thing that I did wonder was whether or not the replacement parts I was using had some kind of manufacturing tolerance that was preventing them from slotting in properly, so I wanted to see if I could use the original center piece rather than the replacement one, but I didn't end up trying that immediately since I was having some difficulty getting the actual bumper bracket out of the center piece, so I did end up just repeatedly trying to push down the assembly again to see if I could somehow get it to work, but for the time being, I had no dice.

(As a side note, it may also interest you to know that the replacement center pieces seemed to grip onto the bumper bracket more tightly than the original one, too, and this was actually a problem since I needed to pry it off slightly to give myself enough leverage to get the bumpers into their slots, but I guess this isn't entirely relevant, so yeah.)

At this point, despair was starting to set in.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ll be honest this has not been going well</p>&mdash; Tiyenti (@TiyentiSR) <a href="https://twitter.com/TiyentiSR/status/1354876884543295489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I had been trying for a few hours at this point and obviously, I was starting to get a little frustrated. I didn't really understand what I was doing wrong, but it still wasn't working! Aaaaaaaa!

Eventually, I did end up managing to get the bumper brackets off of both the original and replacement center pieces, and I ended up going for my idea of taking the replacement bumpers and using the original center piece. This didn't exactly help much, I'll admit, but it was worth a shot, I guess...

But after maybe about another 20 minutes of trying...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Jesus CHRIST it finally seated holy fuck <a href="https://t.co/WcZu3YGXI8">pic.twitter.com/WcZu3YGXI8</a></p>&mdash; Tiyenti (@TiyentiSR) <a href="https://twitter.com/TiyentiSR/status/1354881656222588931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

And then I could start closing up the controller again! So I started to do so, putting in the five four screws in the back, and uh-

Oh nooooo one of the screws fell into the controller??

Yeah so apparently there's actually a hole right next to two of the screws that they can actually fall into if you're not careful, so... yeah, I ended up having to open up the controller again in order to fish it out... I didn't want another lost screw, especially not one that was actually inside of the controller. But thankfully, I did in fact manage to get the screw out, and *bam*

{% include img.html src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es2F010WMAIzrQN.jpg" alt="An image of the now fully repaired controller held up by one hand. A monitor, gaming headset, and desktop computer tower are visible in the background." caption="We back boys" %}

I checked every button with an input display just to make sure everything worked fine and nothing broke, but yeah! My controller is now back to normal! After way longer than I was honestly expecting... but it's back.

It's alright, though. I had nothing much better to do with my time, honestly. It was pretty frustating, though. But now that we're done, we can even get a closer view of that broken bumper assembly, in all of its terribly-designed glory:

{% include img.html src="https://i.imgur.com/ZSYaMEy.jpg" alt="A clearer image of the old broken bumper assembly, now removed from the controller. The assembly appears as a single piece of plastic with the bumpers on either side of a central bendy bit, with two peg holes that make it look vaguely like a face. The crack on the right side is more pronounced than in the last image." caption="Yes. This is the actual design. Being able to make fun of this ~personally~ obviously makes up for the frustration." %}

It's now been about a week since I had attempted and eventually succeeded at this repair, and I can confirm that it works pretty much perfectly. The main thing that's different is that now the controller does admittedly feel a little flimsier - which I assume is a side effect of the fact that, you know, it's supposed to be sealed shut, and the adhesive tape that's normally there to keep the back rubber grips on the controller has obviously been torn off now. And also because I lost a screw. That's. y'know. That's probably not helping either.

In addition, the left bumper doesn't appear to perfectly fit into its slot. It sort of pops out of it a bit if I push on it... but other than that, it basically feels perfectly functional, and you have to note that even if the controller feels slightly worse now, it's a slightly worse feeling *functional* controller, as opposed to a nice feeling half-busted one that's about as useful to me as a paperweight, ha.

<div style="text-align: center;">---</div>

But yeah. That was the process of reparing my controller. Like I said at the start, I figured this would be a nice thing I could potentially write about to kick off some more long-form content, as I've always sorta wanted to do more of that, and this is definitely a better place to unleash my verbostity compared to Twitter.

This may or may not become a series of posts here, hence the category this post is under! But I obviously can't make any guaruntees, as I still don't entirely know what I'll be able to write on here to begin with, but hey. I just wanted to write this, so I did.

Nevertheless, we have reached the end of this post in particular, so for the time being, I'll be out. See y'all.
