                    Hi, I'm <b>Tiyenti</b>*. I'm not that interesting, but my main hobby for a long time has
                    been various different forms of competitive gaming. I'm probably most known for 
                    doing Distance speedruns at the moment, although on occasion I do play other things - 
                    usually some form of time/score attack or multiplayer versus. Beyond gaming I'm somewhat
                    interested in linguistics and, rarely, programming, although I've not got a lot to show for
                    those as my ability and opportunities to engage with those interests are fairly limited.

                    <br /><br />

                    Most of my speedrun PBs are published on <a href="https://speedrun.com/users/Tiyenti">Speedrun.com</a>;
                    you can find videos and live streams of my attempts on <a href="https://youtube.com/@Tiyenti">YouTube</a> and 
                    <a href="https://twitch.tv/Tiyenti">Twitch</a>. Various programming projects of mine, mostly small 
                    utilities or game mods, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Tiyenti">GitHub</a>. I also maintain a list of 
                    <a href="/writeups">writeups</a> on this website to archive some of my longer form writing,
                    although it's not frequently updated and there's probably stuff missing from there.

                    <br /><br />

                    If you need to contact me, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tiyenti.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>
                    or <a href="https://mstdn.games/@Tiyenti" rel="me">Mastodon</a> are probably the easiest methods;
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/TiyentiSR">Twitter</a> ("""X""") remains an option too I suppose but
                    please note I do not actively check my DMs there.
