<p>
    Hi, I'm Tiyenti. I enjoy a variety of differing activies, but for years my largest interest has been gaming; particularly within certain types of competition
    and challenge-focused gaming, such as speedrunning or competitive multiplayer. Outside of this, I also have shown varying levels of interest in other areas,
    such as technology, programming, linguistics, and really just anything I happen to find interesting.
</p>

<p>
    You can see <a href="/writeups">this page</a> for a list of longer-form blog posts and articles I've written that I have chosen to archive on this site;
    I don't do much essay writing or blogging these days so I don't want to advertise that I have A Blog, necessarily, but I figure it makes sense to keep
    these random articles at least somewhat organised.
</p>

<p>
    Here's some of the various things I've made over the years that I consider somewhat notable.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://tiyenti.github.io/distplay/distplay.html">distplay</a>, a controller input display.
    The version linked is an online version based on my original code, which you can save from your browser to use offline. An updated <a href="https://github.com/Californ1a/distplay">Electron fork</a> with 
    some more functionaliy is also available, maintained by <a href="https://github.com/Californ1a">Californ1a</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiyenti/kbdisplay">kbdisplay</a>, a simple keyboard input display for Linux, as I used to run Linux as my
    main OS, but could not find an native Linux solution for an input display for my streams. As I no longer run Linux, I'm no longer maintaning it - I see that there's some forks of it, though.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distance</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1219254079">Hijack - Grip flight tutorial map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Tiyenti/distance.asl">LiveSplit autosplitter script</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.speedrun.com/distance/guide/5k34r">Infodump/guide for new speedrunners</a></li>

</ul>
