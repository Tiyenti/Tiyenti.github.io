    Hi, I'm Tiyenti. I enjoy a variety of differing activies, but for years my largest interest has been gaming; particularly within certain types of competition
    and challenge-focused gaming, such as speedrunning or competitive multiplayer. Outside of this, I also have shown varying levels of interest in other areas,
    such as technology, programming, linguistics, and really just anything I happen to find interesting.
</p>

<p>
    On this site I also having something of a <a href="{% link blog.html %}">blog</a> that I might post on every now and then, but I'll admit I don't really have
    much of a medium for writing, despite finding it to be enjoyable sometimes, so I can't promise anything frequent. You can check out whatever I've written on there
    if you want, though - there's no consistent theme regarding what I post there, I just post anything that I happen to feel like writing about at the time I do it.
