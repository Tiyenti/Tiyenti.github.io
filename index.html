                    Hi. I'm <b>Tiyenti</b>*. I'm not super
                    interesting; I'm mostly known for doing speedruns
                    of the game Distance. On occasion I'll also play some other stuff, but for many years
                    now,
                    that's been my main thing. Beyond gaming
                    I'm also somewhat interested in linguistics, languages, and programming,
                    although I'll admit that I don't have a whole lot to show for any of those,
                    and my ability to actually engage in some of these hobbies is pretty limited
                    these days. Maybe some day that'll change.

                    On this site, you can find some of the <a href="/writeups">writeups</a> I've
                    occasionally done, which may be anything from guides, essays, or blog posts;
                    I don't really have a format and it is not frequently updated.
                    Other than that, you may find some links to the 
                    various social media and content platforms I'm on if you want to
                    watch my speedruns, contact me, or just are interested in what I'm up to.
