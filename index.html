    Hi, I'm Tiyenti. I play video games, and sometimes - albeit very, very rarely - program some software. I also stream every now and then. I don't
    have much to say about myself, admittedly, so here, just have a few links to some stuff I have made that I consider notable.
    I may post on the new <a href="{% link blog.html %}">blog</a> that this site now has every now and then, so maybe check that out.
