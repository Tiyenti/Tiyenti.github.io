                    Hi, I'm <b>Tiyenti</b>*. I'm not super
                    interesting. I'm probably most known for speedrunning the game
                    Distance - I do also play some other stuff as well but that's sort of been
                    my "thing" for the past several years. Beyond gaming I also have some amount
                    of interest in linguistics and, rarely, programming. My abilities and
                    opportunities to engage in those interests are admittedly somewhat limited
                    though, so I've not got a whole lot to show on that front.

                    <br /><br />

                    For now, I've not got too much to share on this site, but
                    below you'll find links to a variety of different social media and content
                    platforms that I'm on if you want to see my speedrun PBs,
                    need to contact me, or are just interested in what I'm up to.

                    <br /><br />
