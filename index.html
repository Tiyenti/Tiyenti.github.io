                    Hi, I'm <b>Tiyenti</b>*. I've done various things over my history of being on the Internet,
                    although my main hobby has generally been some form of competitive gaming. I've done a lot of
                    speedrunning and I tend to enjoy score and time attack games 
                    with occasional multiplayer versus thrown in. Beyond that I'm somewhat interested in linguistics
                    and programming, although I don't engage in those hobbies particularly often; I have a never-published and very
                    incomplete conlang that's changed direction a bunch and kind of stalled out, and I don't
                    have too many ideas for programming projects these days.

                    <br /><br />

                    Most of my speedrun PBs are published on <a href="https://speedrun.com/users/Tiyenti">Speedrun.com</a>;
                    you can find videos and live streams of my attempts on <a href="https://youtube.com/@Tiyenti">YouTube</a> and 
                    <a href="https://twitch.tv/Tiyenti">Twitch</a>. Various programming projects of mine, mostly small 
                    utilities or game mods, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Tiyenti">GitHub</a>. I also maintain a list of 
                    <a href="/writeups">writeups</a> on this website to archive some of my longer form writing,
                    although it's not frequently updated and there's probably stuff missing from there.

                    <br /><br />

                    If you need to contact me, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tiyenti.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>
                    or <a href="https://mstdn.games/@Tiyenti" rel="me">Mastodon</a> are probably the easiest methods;
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/TiyentiSR">Twitter</a> ("""X""") remains an option too I suppose but
                    please note I do not actively check my DMs there.
