    Hi, I'm Tiyenti. I enjoy a variety of differing activies, but for years my largest interest has been gaming; particularly within certain types of competition
    and challenge-focused gaming, such as speedrunning or competitive multiplayer. Outside of this, I also have shown varying levels of interest in other areas,
    such as technology, programming, linguistics, and really just anything I happen to find interesting.
</p>

<p>
    On this site I also having something of a <a href="{% link blog.html %}">blog</a> that I might post on every now and then, but I'll admit I don't really have
    much of a medium for writing, despite finding it to be enjoyable sometimes, so I can't promise anything frequent. You can check out whatever I've written on there
    if you want, though - there's no consistent theme regarding what I post there, I just post anything that I happen to feel like writing about at the time I do it.
</p>

<p>
    Here's some of the various things I've made over the years that I consider somewhat notable.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Californ1a/distplay">distplay</a>, a controller input display originally created by me, and
    now updated and maintained by my friend <a href="https://github.com/Californ1a">Californ1a</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Tiyenti/kbdisplay">kbdisplay</a>, a simple keyboard input display for Linux, as I used to run Linux as my
    main OS, but could not find an native Linux solution for an input display for my streams.</li>
</ul>
